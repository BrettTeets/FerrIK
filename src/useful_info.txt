 /**
     * mJoint	The joint attached to this FabrikBone3D.
     * <p>
     * Each bone has a single FabrikJoint3D which controls the angle to which the bone is
     * constrained with regard to the previous (i.e. earlier / closer to the base) bone in its chain.
     * <p>
     * By default, a joint is not constrained (that is, it is free to rotate up to 180
     * degrees in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction), however a joint may be
     * constrained by specifying constraint angles via the
     * {@link #setBallJointConstraintDegs(float)}, {@link #setHingeJointClockwiseConstraintDegs(float)},
     * and {@link #setHingeJointAnticlockwiseConstraintDegs(float)} methods.
     * <p>
     * You might think that surely a bone has two joints, one at the beginning and one at
     * the end - however, consider an empty chain to which you add a single bone: It has
     * a joint at its start, around which the bone may rotate (and which it may optionally
     * be constrained).
     * <p>
     * When a second bone is added to the chain, the joint at the start of this second bone
     * controls the rotational constraints with regard to the first ('base') bone, and so on.
     * <p>
     * During the forward (tip-to-base) pass of the FABRIK algorithm, the end effector is
     * unconstrained and snapped to the target. As we then work from tip-to-base each
     * previous bone is constrained by the joint in the outer bone until we reach the base,
     * at which point, if we have a fixed base location, then we snap the base bone start
     * location to it, or if we do not have a fixed base location we project the new start
     * location along the reverse direction of the bone by its length.
     * <p>
     * During the backward (base-to-tip) pass, each bone is constrained by the joint angles
     * relative to the bone before it, ensuring that all constraints are enforced.

on the different types of joints.
/** 
	 * The type of joint that this object represents.
	 *
	 * <ul><li><strong>JointType.BALL</strong> - A ball joint (or 'ball and socket joint'). This type of joint
	 * has a single contraint angle which is the extent to which it can rotate with regard to the
	 * direction of the previous bone in a chain. Alternatively, it may be set to 180 degrees, which
	 * is no constraint, or 0 degrees, which is entirely contrained.</li>
	 * <li><strong>JointType.GLOBAL_HINGE</strong> - A global hinge joint constrains rotation of the
	 * joint about a global direction unit vector, that is, a direction specified in world-space.
	 * A hinge joint is like the hinge on a door - unlike a ball joint it has a clockwise and
	 * anti-clockwise set of constraints where, both of these directions are specified in the
	 * range 0 to 180 degrees.</li>
	 * <li><strong>JointType.LOCAL_HINGE</strong> - A local hinge is similar to a global hinge, but in
	 * a local hinge the hinge rotation axis is specified in local space, that is, relative to the
	 * direction of the bone rather than to a 'world-space' global absolute direction. A local 
	 * <p>
	 * A local hinge in the human body would be analogous to elbow or knee joints, which are
	 * constrained about the perpendicular axis of the arm or leg they're attached to. However,
	 * unlike an elbow or knee joint, a local hinge may rotate up to a maximum of 180 degrees in
	 * both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions unless the mHingeClockwiseConstraintDegs and/or
	 * mHingeAntiClockwiseConstraintDegs properties have been set to lower values.</li>
